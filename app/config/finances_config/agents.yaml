    ## üìå Resumen General

    Los escenarios presentados muestran distintas opciones de inversi√≥n utilizando una base de 1000 euros durante 12 meses. La elecci√≥n de cada escenario depende del nivel de riesgo que est√©s dispuesto a asumir:

    - **Escenario 1**: Alta rentabilidad estimada (20%), pero tambi√©n alto riesgo, ya que se trata de una criptomoneda (Dogecoin).
    - **Escenarios 2, 3 y 4**: Alternativas con riesgo medio y rendimientos m√°s moderados. Est√°n basadas en acciones de empresas reconocidas, con retornos que combinan crecimiento del valor y dividendos.

    Estas opciones permiten **diversificar** tu cartera de inversi√≥n, algo √∫til para **reducir el riesgo general** y **aumentar el potencial de retorno**. Aunque cada escenario cubre solo un a√±o, podr√≠as reinvertir los resultados en el segundo a√±o para acercarte al objetivo de 2500 euros en total.
